Using a rollup plugin to generate a html resource

https://gitlab.com/thekelvinliu/rollup-plugin-static-site

make a simple html plugin

htmlwebpack plugins (sub plugins)

-- webpack-subresource-integrity
https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-subresource-integrity

subresource integrety https://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/ (integrity attribute??)

-- appcache-webpack-plugin
this is the old appcache PWA feature (application Cache under devtools)

-- favicons-webpack-plugin

https://github.com/jantimon/favicons-webpack-plugin

has wonderfull html injection
Note: html-webpack-plugin must come before favicons-webpack-plugin in the plugins array.
path to logo can be relative, absolute path (from //) or node module resolution path (no / or ./ as part of the name)

https://github.com/jantimon/favicons-webpack-plugin#advanced-usage

under the hood uses https://github.com/itgalaxy/favicons (node module)
// wonderfull i can use this to make manifest.json files)))
