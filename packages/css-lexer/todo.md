## DONE
> read/watched a bit on parsing seems my idea is to make a LR (left-to-right) parser with some adjustable grammer, so start with grammer framework and make it adjustable, print out grammer tree (in ascii), see the possibility for slots (extention points in the grammer).

### summary

Read a book on parsing, and some more on css grammer, but for now just collect information on parsing
- would be nice to use general LRAR(1) parser (like yacc) but then for javascript, not sure how to go about this
- for now lexing (+ some intelligence) would be enough to rewrite a css document if we only need to re-write urls() and @import statements and the like


## TODO
- (will not be done): parsing part begins
- (will not be done): make parsing pluggable , i didnt read a book on parsing yet, but some kind of left-to-right parser would make sense
- (planned): first need some sort of verifier, in he console [wiki][wiki-ansi-ctrl-codes]

### summary

No general parsing will be build for now, stay with syntax parsing and url rewrite/resolve
- verifyier should be made

## HAMMERTIME

- (will not be done): make some color console magic
