- hypothetical cross size: layout along main axes and treat "auto" as fit-content.
- align-xxx: cross axis alignments
- justify-xxx: main axis alignments
@cross axis
- align-contents: aligns "flex-lines" (parallel to main axis) "main-axe parallel bands" (multiline only), default "stretch"
- align-items/align-self: aligns items in parallel to the cross-axis, (like justify-content in the main axis), but clamped to a a "main-axe parallel bands"
@main axis
- justify-contents: alignment of items accross the main-axis
- IGNORED IN FLEX: justify-items/justify-self: (ignored in flexbox layout)

## Alignment

1. during calculations "auto" margins are treated as 0
2. before "justify-content" or "align-self", positive free space is distributed to auto margins
3. overlflow boxes ignore auto margins in the direction of the overflow, and overflow in end direction
4. alignment does not have any effect in the direction of the auto-margin, because automargin eats up all space in the "end" direction
  -- this makes  margin: 0 auto; -> margin-left: 0, margin-right: auto

# 8.2 "justify-content"
   justify along the main axis (everything except "stretch" and "baseline")  flex-start|end, center
   - flex-start: nomen est omen.
   - flex-end: like flex-start but reverse
   - center: packed towards center, 
      - overflow in both directions if there is negative space
   - "space-between" items (equally distributed)
      - IF space is negative OR only 1 line THEN this is same as "flex-start"
      - first item is flush with "main-start" edge, last item is flush with "main-end"
        space between is equally distributed, (what happens with negavtive space?, ==> will just overflow in the main-end direction)
   - "space-around" 
      - only one item, flush with "center"
      - negative or zero free space (because margin auto consumed all, or flex-container not big enough to hold all items) then overflow in main-end direction
      - postive free space and nr items >= 2 then <total freespace> = 2*d + d*(n-1);

# 8.3 "align-items"/"align-self" (all except, "space-between" and "space-around"), so flex-start|end, baseline, stretch, center
     - "auto" (only for align-self), defers to parent box align-items value
     -  "flex-start": speaks for itself
     -  "flex-end": 
        - (nowrap): will flush with cross end
        - wrap && nnegative free space: flush with flex-start
        - wrap && postive free space: multiline flus at cross-end on each line
     -  "center": if single line(no-wrap) will overflow on both sides (cross start|cross end) if free space is negative
     -  "center": if multiline and freespace is negative will flush with cross start
     -  "center" && positive freespace and multiline, will flush at the center of each flex-line
     -  stretch, if no freespace was consumed by margin auto in the cross axis and there is freespace, will stretch, respecting min-height/max-height

# 8.4 "align-content" packing flex lines (flex-start, )
    -flex-start, pack the flex lines at the start, (respecting min-content)
    -flex-end, pack the flex lines at the end, (respecting min-content, size)
    -space-between, note if free space is negatve is 
    -space-around,

#8.5 Flex Container Baselines
    - Flex container participates in flex-item alignment
    - derives the baseline from shared inter-item baselines
    - when display is "inline-flex" this baseline can be aligned with other elements outside the flex container
  
    - IF inline-axis = main-axis
        - alignment baseline of the container, is created from the inner baseline alignment "align-items:baseline"
        - if the flex-container has at least 1 item take the baseline from that item (after positioned internally)
        - flexbos has no items, synthesize baseline accourding to "https://www.w3.org/TR/css-align-3/#alignment-baseline"
  
    - IF inline-axis = cross-axis
        - baseline (of the flex-container) is begotted from the baseline first flexitem 
        - if the container has no itemes then synthesize according to rules of "https://www.w3.org/TR/css-align-3/#alignment-baseline"
    - 
#9 Flex Layout Algorithm

# Steps

1 (9.1) "anonymous block container flex item", = yes placeholders for ambient "textnodes" etc

2 (9.2) "line length determination"
     Determine the available space for "main" and "cross" space
      - if dimension is definite size, use that
      - if dimension is min-content or max content contstraint use that
      - else: substract flex containers margin, border and padding from the space avail for flex container in that dimension, use this value

3 (9.2) determine for flex-item:
        - flex-base size
        - hypotetical main size
      
      Steps to do the above:
        3.A If item has "definite" flex-basis, use that
        3.B If item has 
          + intrinsic aspect ratio       
          + flex-basis: content -> almost equivalent to "max-content"
          + definite cross-size 
          THEN
          flex-basis = aspect-ratio*cross-size
        3.C IF
            - flex-basis:content
              OR 
            - depens on available space and is sized undr min/max constraints
            THEN
             calc "main size"
             flex-basis= main size
        3.D IF 
            - flex-basis:content
              OR
            - flex-basis depends on available space (auto?)
            AND
            - if available space size is infinite (main-axis is along the block-axis)
            THEN
              item layout is like "box in an ortogonal flow" (CSS-3 Writing modes)
              flex-base size is max-content in the "main-axis"  
        3.E ELSE
          size item into available space with "used flex basis" in place o main size
          treat flex-basis:content as "max-content"
          IF 
            cross-size is needed (because flow-direction is column) to determine main size is block-direction
          AND
            cross-size is "auto"(not definite) use fit-content as the flex-item cross-size
          THEN
            flex-base size is items main-size
        
          determening FLEX-BASE:
            - min/max main size ignored (no clamping)  
            - box sizing that floor content box at zero are ignored
   
   HYPOTHETICAL MAIN SIZE: = flex base size clamped to min/max main-size

4. Determine main-size of flex container: 
     make all auto margins on flex-items 0  

    #9.3 Main size determination
5.  Collect flex items into flex line
    - single line: all flex items on the same line
    - multiline (soly determined by flex-wrap: wrap)
      collect consecutive items until an item doesnt fit and move it to the next flex-line

6 Resolve the flexible length
   + in case (5) was not a snug fit and there is freespace
   + ofc there must be at least 1 item wich can resolve to flex length
   + Resolve Flexible Length  (see Â§9.7)
 
   Â§9.4 Cross size determination
 
7 determine "hypothetical cross size" for each item
    + take into account main-size of each item
    + treat "auto" cross size as "fit-content"
 
8 Calculate cross-size of each flex line
    - for single line, easy,the cross-size is the flex-contaner cross size (min/max/definite)
    - for each flex-line do steps:
       1. -- collect all flex-items
          (baseline, main-axes=inline-axis)
          IF
          -- whose inline-axis parallel to main-axis (English , not Japanese etc)
          -- align-self is "baseline" (explicitly set or copied from align-items in parent container)
          -- cross-axis margins are non-auto (both)
          THEN
          CALCULATE SUM:
            -- measure distance between baseline and "cross-start"
            -- measure distance between baseline and "cross-end" 
       2. -- for all items not picked in (1), find item with largest outer "hypothetical cross size" (see point 7)

       3. cross size of flex-line is largest of 8.1 and 8.2

       post-production:
       If single-line flex-line then clamp cross-size to container min/max cross-size

9 Handle "align-content":"stretch" (this is the default, flex lines take up available space)
    IF
    + the cross-size of the container is definite
    + there is available space left in the cross dimenion (after substracting sum of all cross size of all flex-lines)
    THEN
      spread out flex-lines in cross-axis by equal amounts

10 flex-items with visibility: collapse
    1. note the cross-size as the strut size and restart layout
    2. on second run (restart layout)
      A. treat "collapsed" items as having '0' main-size (when collecting in (5.))
      B. for the rest of the algorithem ignore collapsed size entirely (as if display: none)
        -- except when reaching point 8 , if any of the cross-sizes is less then the largest strut size , set
           cross-size of the flex-line to the strut size.
    3. skip on "second round" step 10.2

11 Determine the used cross size of each flex-item 
   A.IF 
     + align-self:"stretch" (default)  then "cross-size" is auto
     + NO margins in the cross direction is auto
  THEN
     1. used outer cross-size = cross cross size of flex line
     2. clamped at used min/max cross sizes
  ELSE
    cross size = hypothetical cross size   
 
  B.IF 
    the align-self is "stretch", 
  THEN
    1.redo layout for its contents, 
    2.treat "used size" as definite cross size.
    3.layout % sized children with the definite cross size

  Â§ 9.5 Main axis alignment   

12. Distribute remaining free space for each flex line
   1. if at least one margin is auto, distribute the free space amongst these margins
   2. Align the items along the main axis per "justify-content"

  $ 9.6 Cross-Axis alignment

13. resolve cross-axis automargins
   IF flex item cross-size (set auto margins to '0') < flex-line cross size
      extend auto margins (equally) to fill up to flex-size:   
   
   ELSE (no free space left to distribute)
      1.SET any block-start/inline-start margin (whatever is in cross-size) is auto, set to zero
      2.SET opposite margin at (block-end/inline-end) so that the outer cross size of the item equals the cross size of flex-line.
        (Most likely this will be negative)
   
14. For the other flex-items with no margins: 
     1. Allign all flex items to the cross axis per "align-self"  

15. Determine the flex containers used cross size:
   IF cross size is definite size, 
   THEN use that (clamped by used min/max cross size of the flex-container)
   ELSE use sum of the flex lines cross sizes, clamped by used min/max cross sizes of flex container

16. Align all flex-lines per "align content"

SUFFIX:

$9.7 Resolving Flexible Length

1. Determine the used flex-factor
  A.sum = all 'hypothetical main sizes' (see point 3 in Flex Layout Algorithm )
  B.IF
      sum > "inner main size"
    THEN
      flex-factor = "flex-grow"  
    ELSE
      flex-factor = "flex-shrink"

2.Size inflexible items
  IF
    flex-item has flex factor '0'
    OR
    using flex-factor=flex-grow  && flex-base > "hypothetical main size"
    OR
    using flex-factor=flex-shrink && flex-base < "hypthetical main size"
  THEN
    FREEZE, target main size = hypothetical main size

3.Calculate initial free space (this can be negative)
  1.(for every flex-line) Sum outer sizes of all flex-items
      - for frozen flex-items use "hypothetical main size" (2)
      - for not-frozen flex-items use outer "flex-basis" size
  2. substract (3.1) from container inner "main-size"

4. LOOP:

  A. EXIT LOOP IF all flex-items are frozen

  B. CALCULATE REMAINING FREE SPACE (same as 3) (note this can be negative)
     1. calculate sum of the used flex-factors (see 2.)
     IF 
       sum (4.B.1) < 1
     THEN
       RFS = inital free space * sum (4.B.1)
     ELSE
       RFS = same as (3.1-3.2) but use current list of frozen flex  items

  C. DISTRIBUTE FREE SPACE AMONGST unfrozen items
      EXIT LOOP IF RFS = 0
      LOOP FOR EACH NOT-FROZEN flex-item     
        IF
          flex-factor=flex-grow
        THEN
          flex-factor-ratio = flex-factor/(sum of all not-frozen flex-factors) 
          SET target main-size = flex-base size + RFS*flex-factor-ratio
        ELSEIF flex-factor=flex-shrink
          (for flex-shrink)
          scaled-flex-shrink-factor = flex-shrink*flex-base-size
          ratio = scaled-flex-shrink-factor/(sum of all not-frozen scaled-flex-shrink-factor)
          set target main-size = flex-base size - ratio*RFS
        ELSE
          do nothing
      END LOOP

  D. FIX MIN/MAX violations
      CLAMP each items target main-size to used min/max main-size
      IF 
        target-main-size was < min-main-size 
      THEN
        mark as MIN VIOLATION
        total-violations += min-main-size - target-main-size (this is positive)
        target-main-size = min-main-size
      IF 
        target-main-size > max-main-size
      THEN
        mark as MAX VIOLATION
        total-violations += max-main-size - target-main-size (this is negative)   
        target-main-size = max-main-size
    
  E.
     IF
       total-violations = 0
     THEN
       FREEZE ALL ITEMS
       EXIT LOOP
     
     IF
       total-violations < 0 (overshoot) (more "max violations" then "min violations")
     THEN  
       FREEZE all MAX violations
     ELSE
       FREEZE ALL MIN VIOLATIONS

  F.Return to START LOOP

5. set each items main-size to TARGET-MAIN-SIZE

Â§9.8 Definite and indefinite sizes

1. IF
      - fl-container is single-line 
      AND
      - fl-container has definite outer cross-size
   THEN
     all stretched items in the cross-size are definite

2. IF 
    - fl-container has definite main-size
   THEN 
    - post-flexed main-size of items are definite
3. Once cross-size of flex-line is determined,
   items IN auto-size-flex-containers are considered definite (see 11)

Â§9.9 INTRINSIC SIZES (see also css-sizing-3)

Â§ 9.9.1 Flex container instrinsic main sizes (read Â§9.9.3 first)
    
  A.DEFINITION: "max-content main size" size of flex container
   - "smallest"!!! main-size, that can satisfy the (Â§9.9.3.2) "max-content distribution" of the flex-items
   - insofar as it is allowed by the items own flexibility
     1. calculate "max-content flex fraction"
       IF 
         ("max-content-contribution" > flex-base)
       THEN
         flex-grow-factor = value of flex-grow
       ->  max-content-flex-fraction = ("max-content-contribution" - flex-base)/flex-grow-factor
       
       IF 
         ("max-content-contribution" < flex-base)
       THEN
         flex-shrink-factor = value of flex-shrink
         scaled-flex-shrink-factor = flex-shrink-factor*flex-base-size
       ->  max-content-flex-fraction = ("max-content-contribution" - flex-base)/scaled-flex-shrink-factor 
       
      2. Place flex-items into lines of infinite length (undefinite)

      3. within each line, find largest "max-content-flex-fraction"
        for each item:
         flex base + (flex-grow or scaled-flex-shrink )*"max-content-flex-franction" (9.9.1.1)
      
      4. clamp result of (3 above) to max/min main-size

  B.DEFINITION "min-content main-size" 
    1. For a single line flex container: is the same as 9.9.1.A except that flex item's "min-content-contribution" is used.
    2. For multiline flex container: simply the largest "min-content-contribution" of all the flex-items in the container.


Â§ 9.9.2 Flex container instrinsic cross sizes

1. IF
     single-line container,
   THEN
     largerst min-content distribution of its flex-item
   
   IF 
     multi-line container
   THEN
     sum of flex-line cross-sizes (sized under min-content/max-content constraint
     
   IF 
     multi-line flex-wrap: column wrap;
   THEN
     1.find max of (flex-line) min-content/max-content cross-size
     2.use (1) (above) for "available space" (css-sizing-3) in the cross-axis during layout 



Â§ 9.9.3 Flex ITEM instrinsic size contributions

1. the main-size "min-content-contribution" of a flex-item is the
   1. min-content-contribution = max( outer "min-content" main-size , outer "preferred-size", aka "width"/"height" properties, if it is not "auto")
   2. above max clamped (if it is not growable) by flex-base size.
   3. above min clamped (if it is not shrinkable) by the flex-base size.
   4. further claimped by "min/max" main size

2. the main-size "max-content-contribution" of a flex-item is the
   1. max-content-contribution = max( outer "max-content" main-size, outer perferred size, aka "width"/"height" properties, if it is not "auto")
   2. above max clamped (if it is not growable) by the flex-base size
   3. above min clamped (if it is not shrinkable) by the flex-base size
   4. further claimped by "min/max" main size
   
     
   
       

         



           
        
     




set flex-item "target main size" to "hypothetical main size" (see point 3 in Flex Layout algorithm)
