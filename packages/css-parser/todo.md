## DONE
> read/watched a bit on parsing seems my idea is to make a LR (left-to-right) parser with some adjustable grammer, so start with grammer framework and make it adjustable, print out grammer tree (in ascii), see the possibility for slots (extention points in the grammer).

## TODO
- parsing part begins
- make parsing pluggable , i didnt read a book on parsing yet, but some kind of left-to-right parser would make sense
- first need some sort of varifier, in he console [wiki][wiki-ansi-ctrl-codes]

## HAMMERTIME
